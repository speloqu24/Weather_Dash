# Project Objective

Link: https://speloqu24.github.io/Weather_Dash/

The main objective of this project was to demonstrate a successful call to an API that would help display current and forecasted weather.

# API Call with AJax

My first approach to this project included Fetch, at that point I hadn't seen much of AJAX. Our instructor introduce AJax to us briefly in class but really dug into it during a review session we had. At that point I realized that to me AJAX makes more sense and gets to the point quicker (less code). The structure is straight forward. Thats when I changed my approach from FETCH to AJAX.

# Dynamic HTML & JQuery --

It may have taken a few tries to really get started creating HTML elements dynamically through JQuery, but once I got going I really started to understand the possibilities of of dynamic creation. The logic is a perfect map to the HTML structure.

# Template Literals

It was another insight into how to shorten code and approach by combining JQUERY and Template literals to create elements.
